🔍 **Testing Instructions:**
===========================

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Chrome/Edge)
   - Clear "Cached images and files"
   - Or use Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh

2. **Test Each Account:**
   
   **FREE Account (rijalsawan@gmail.com):**
   - Login and navigate to file upload area
   - Should show "Up to 102.4 MB per file"
   - Try uploading 50MB file → Should work
   - Try uploading 200MB file → Should fail with size limit message

   **PRO Account (jhon@gmail.com):**
   - Login and navigate to file upload area
   - Should show "Up to 1 GB per file" with "PRO" badge
   - Try uploading 500MB file → Should work
   - Try uploading 2GB file → Should fail

   **BUSINESS Account (test@gmail.com):**
   - Login and navigate to file upload area  
   - Should show "Up to 5 GB per file" with "BUSINESS" badge
   - Try uploading 2GB file → Should work
   - Try uploading 10GB file → Should fail

3. **Debug Checklist:**
   - Open browser dev tools (F12)
   - Check Network tab for /api/files/upload-config requests
   - Check Console for upload config logs
   - Verify response shows correct userPlan and userMaxFileSizeFormatted
   - Look for any 401/403 authentication errors

4. **Create Test Files:**
   ```bash
   # Create test files of different sizes
   fsutil file createnew test-50mb.txt 52428800    # 50MB
   fsutil file createnew test-500mb.txt 524288000  # 500MB
   fsutil file createnew test-2gb.txt 2147483648   # 2GB
   ```

🚨 **If Issues Persist:**
========================
1. Check if JWT token is valid (not expired)
2. Verify user is properly logged in
3. Check localStorage for old cached data
4. Look for JavaScript errors in console
5. Try logging out and back in
6. Use the "🔄 Refresh Limits" button in dev mode

📋 **Expected Behavior:**
========================
- Upload modal should show correct file size limits immediately
- Plan badges should appear for PRO/BUSINESS users
- File size validation should match the displayed limits
- Error messages should reference the correct plan limits
- No more FREE plan limits showing for PRO/BUSINESS users

🎉 **Ready for Testing!**
The upload modal should now correctly display and enforce the proper upload limits for each user plan.
