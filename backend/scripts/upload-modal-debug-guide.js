📋 Current Test Account Setup:
------------------------------
✅ rijalsawan@gmail.com (sawan rijal) → FREE plan (102.4 MB)
✅ jhon@gmail.com (jhon doe) → PRO plan (1 GB) 
✅ test@gmail.com (test test) → BUSINESS plan (5 GB)
✅ pwnrijal@gmail.com (Pawan Rijal) → FREE plan (102.4 MB)

🔍 Upload Modal Issues to Check:
-------------------------------
1. FileUpload component fetches upload-config on mount
2. Upload config shows correct limits per user plan
3. File size validation uses correct limits
4. Error messages show correct plan limits
5. UI displays correct plan badges

🎯 Debugging Steps:
------------------
1. Login as jhon@gmail.com (PRO user)
2. Open file upload modal/area
3. Check browser dev tools:
   - Network tab: Look for /api/files/upload-config request
   - Console: Look for upload config logs
   - Response should show: userMaxFileSizeFormatted: "1 GB", userPlan: "PRO"

4. Try uploading a file > 100MB but < 1GB
   - Should succeed for PRO user
   - Should fail for FREE user

5. Login as test@gmail.com (BUSINESS user)  
   - Should show 5 GB limit
   - Should accept files up to 5GB

🚨 Common Issues:
----------------
- Frontend caching old config (try hard refresh: Ctrl+F5)
- Token not passed correctly to upload-config endpoint
- Upload config not being refetched after login
- FileUpload component using cached/stale data
- Browser localStorage containing old session data

🔧 Quick Fixes to Try:
---------------------
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check Network tab for 401/403 errors on upload-config
4. Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
5. Check console for any JavaScript errors

💡 Test File Suggestions:
------------------------
- Create a 50MB file (should work for all plans)
- Create a 500MB file (should fail for FREE, work for PRO/BUSINESS)  
- Create a 2GB file (should fail for FREE/PRO, work for BUSINESS)
`);

console.log('- Force refetch upload config after login');
console.log('- Clear component state on user change');
console.log('- Add cache-busting to upload-config request');
console.log('- Improve error handling for config fetch failures');
