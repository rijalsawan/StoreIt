# Storage and Upload Limits Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Backend Storage Limits - FIXED
**Problem**: Your account still had 1TB storage limit despite having no subscription (should be 500MB for FREE)
**Solution**: Ran `fix-storage-limits.js` script which corrected your account and others

**Verification**:
```bash
# Your account now shows correct limits:
Plan: FREE
Storage Limit: 500MB (524,288,000 bytes) ‚úÖ CORRECT
Upload Limit: 100MB (107,374,182 bytes) ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Frontend Storage Display - FIXED
**Problem**: Dashboard showing old/cached storage values
**Solutions Applied**:
- Added cache-busting timestamps to API calls
- Updated fallback values to use 500MB instead of 1TB
- Enhanced debugging and logging
- Display API-provided formatted values instead of recalculating

### 3. ‚úÖ Upload Limits in Modal - FIXED
**Problem**: File upload modal not showing correct upload limits for different plans
**Solutions Applied**:
- Added upload config fetching on FileUpload component mount
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Updated dropzone to use dynamic `maxSize` from user's plan
- Added plan badges and better UI feedback
- Disabled upload until config is loaded

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Storage Limits (Backend Verification)
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/check-my-storage.js
# Should show: Plan: FREE, Storage Limit: 500MB
```

### 2. Test Frontend Storage Display
1. **Refresh your browser completely** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Login to your account
3. Go to Dashboard
4. Check browser console for these logs:
   ```
   üîç Dashboard - Storage data from API: {...}
   üîç Dashboard - Plan detected: FREE
   ```
5. Verify storage indicator shows "XXX of 500MB used"

### 3. Test Upload Limits in File Upload Modal
1. Open file upload modal
2. Check browser console for:
   ```
   üîÑ Fetching upload config...
   ‚úÖ Upload config loaded: {...}
   ```
3. Verify upload area shows "Up to 102.4 MB per file" (for FREE plan)
4. Try uploading a file larger than 100MB - should be rejected with proper error message

### 4. Test Different Plans (If Available)
**PRO Plan Users**: Should see 1GB upload limit
**BUSINESS Plan Users**: Should see 5GB upload limit

## Current Status

### Your Account (rijalsawan@gmail.com):
- **Backend**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Returns correct limits
- **Plan**: FREE (no active subscription)
- **Storage Limit**: 500MB ‚úÖ 
- **Upload Limit**: 100MB ‚úÖ

### Test Results:
```
‚úÖ Storage Limit: CORRECT (500MB)
‚úÖ Upload Limit: CORRECT (100MB) 
‚úÖ Backend APIs: Working correctly
‚úÖ Frontend Components: Updated with fixes
```

## What to Test in Browser

1. **Hard refresh** your browser (important for cache clearing)
2. **Login and go to Dashboard**
3. **Check storage display** - should show correct 500MB limit
4. **Open file upload** - should show 102.4MB limit for FREE plan
5. **Try uploading large file** - should show plan-specific error message

## If Issues Persist

### Browser Cache Issues:
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console
- Clear browser cache completely

### Frontend Debugging:
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for upload config logs
- Check Network tab to see API responses

### Manual API Testing:
```bash
# Test storage info endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/user/dashboard

# Test upload config endpoint  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/files/upload-config
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### FREE Plan (Your Current Plan):
- ‚úÖ Storage Limit: 500MB total
- ‚úÖ Upload Limit: 100MB per file  
- ‚úÖ Error Message: "Maximum file size for FREE plan is 102.4 MB"

### PRO Plan:
- ‚úÖ Storage Limit: 100GB total
- ‚úÖ Upload Limit: 1GB per file
- ‚úÖ Error Message: "Maximum file size for PRO plan is 1 GB"

### BUSINESS Plan:  
- ‚úÖ Storage Limit: 1TB total
- ‚úÖ Upload Limit: 5GB per file
- ‚úÖ Error Message: "Maximum file size for BUSINESS plan is 5 GB"

All backend APIs are now working correctly. The main issue was likely frontend caching of the old values.
