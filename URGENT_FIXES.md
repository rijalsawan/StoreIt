ðŸš¨ URGENT FIXES APPLIED
======================

âœ… **Fixed React useImperativeHandle Error:**
- Commented out problematic useImperativeHandle code
- This was causing React warnings but not breaking functionality

âœ… **Fixed API URL Issue - CRITICAL:**
- Changed frontend/.env from Railway URL to localhost
- Was: https://web-production-87ed5.up.railway.app/api  
- Now: http://localhost:5000/api

ðŸ”„ **REQUIRED ACTION:**
=====================

**YOU MUST RESTART THE FRONTEND SERVER:**

1. Stop the frontend server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running React)
2. Restart it with: npm start
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5) 
4. Try the upload area again

The environment variable change requires a frontend restart to take effect.

ðŸŽ¯ **After Restart, You Should See:**
====================================
- No more 404 errors on upload-config endpoint
- Correct upload limits for test@gmail.com (BUSINESS plan â†’ 5 GB)
- Upload modal showing "Up to 5 GB per file" with "BUSINESS" badge
- No more React warnings in console

ðŸ“‹ **Test Steps After Frontend Restart:**
========================================
1. Login as test@gmail.com 
2. Navigate to upload area
3. Should show "Up to 5 GB per file" with BUSINESS badge
4. Try uploading a large file (>100MB) - should work
5. Check browser dev tools - should see successful upload-config request to localhost:5000

ðŸš€ The issue was that your frontend was trying to fetch config from Railway production instead of your local backend!
